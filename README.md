# 1. General Information
    + This Verilog implementation of the Trivium stream cipher consists of:
        - The core components
        - A testbench that tests the top level functionality
        - A Python reference implementation for the generation of test vectors and possibly other scenarios
        - Currently a single bare-metal test for the Zynq
    + The interface of the core conforms to the AXI4LITE bus protocol
    + The hdl/src directory contains the source code of the core, whereas the testbench can be found in hdl/tb
    + The AXI-related code is located in hdl/ip and can be used to create and package the core
    + Test vectors and the python reference implementation can be found in the reference_implementation/ directory
    + The specification of Trivium can be found in [1]
	
# 2. Current Status
    The core has successfully been synthesized, placed and routed in a design. In addition, the test coverage of
    the behavioral simulation is complete, with the core passing all tests. In addition, the core was packaged
    as an AXI IP core and tested in a simple Zynq design. A few bare-metal tests were written which interface
    the core from one of the Cortex A9 cores in the PS. All tests execute successfully.
    
# 3. Synthesizing and Testing The Core
    + Synthesis
        - The core requires no special constraints to function
        - All necessary code can be found in the hdl/src directory
    + Testing
        - The testbench for the behavioral simulation can be found in hdl/tb
        - Running the test requires two files that contain the test vectors
        - The test vector files can be generated by executing the script reference_implementation/trivium_py.py
        - The test vectors consist of randomly generated input (trivium_ref_in.txt) and corresponding encrypted
          outputs (trivisum_ref_out.txt)
        - Be sure to copy these test vector files to the directory of the project that runs the testbench if you
          are using Xilinx ISE or include them in the project in case of Vivado
        - The testbench is self checking and will abort with a success message if all tests pass
        - Create a simple Zynq design with a single Zynq 7 Processing System core and use the bare-metal 
          test code found in sw/basic_test
		
# 4. TODOs
    + Add support for Linux integration via device driver (and possibly modifications to the device tree)
    + Add Linux user-space tests
